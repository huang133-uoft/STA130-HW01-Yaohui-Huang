    "I perfferd the code improved by the chatbot. The original code created a complex logic when it comes to identifying and selecting the doors. The new code avoids to remove elemnts from the list by using the list comprehensions method to filter it. This makes the logic of the code much more clear and easy to understand. Additionaly, the chatbot simplified the variavble names, which also improved its readiblility."

    "3). Based on my expriences, interacting with the chatbot helps a lot with the course work, espcially when I can't understanding the codes clearly, or having some errors and need a further suggestion about coding. As a learning tool, it can explain the course content in a concise way, which strongly improved the readibility of definitions and concepts. For example, it is able to identify the \"Markovian Chatbot\" coding and give a line by line explaination for the original code. Additionally, it generates an example using that original code to help me get better knowledge about that. It can also troubleshoot and give suggestions to the codes I provided, which is also helpful for this course. When I give a error message, it can quickly indentify the type of error and analyze the possible reasons for it. It is able to locate the line the error happens precisely and reduce time for troubleshooting. When I want a further suggestion about the coding, it is also able to help me. For example in the \"Monte Hall\" question, the chatbot can understand the logic of the orginal coding and provide a simplified version for that. Additionally, every time the chatbot wrote me something, it comes with its detaily explaination so I'm able to understand and improve from that."
